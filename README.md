# Solectrus hosting example

There are two different ways to install Solectrus:

1. [Local installation on in-house server](/step-by-step/in-house)

   You need a Linux server with Intel Architecture in your house. Tested with a Synology NAS.

2. [Distributed installation on Raspberry Pi pushing to a remote server](/step-by-step/external-server)

   You need a Raspberry Pi in your house **and** a remote server somewhere in the internet. Tested with Hetzner Cloud.

Off course, you can also need a SENEC device in your house ;-)
