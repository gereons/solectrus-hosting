# Solectrus hosting example

There are two different ways to install **Solectrus**:

1. [Local installation on in-house server](/step-by-step/in-house)

   You need a Linux server with Intel/AMD architecture at home (tested with a Synology NAS)

2. [Distributed installation on Raspberry Pi + remote server](/step-by-step/external-server)

   You need a Raspberry Pi at home **and** a remote server somewhere on the internet (tested with Hetzner Cloud)

Of course, you also need a SENEC device connected to your LAN (tested with a SENEC Home V3 hybrid).
